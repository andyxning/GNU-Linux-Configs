### Tmux
`tmux/.tmux.conf` contains the **tmux** configuration i use in my working.  

  **Note**: Almost all the configuration i use is copied from [tmux-productive-mouse-free-development_zh](https://www.gitbook.com/book/aquaregia/tmux-productive-mouse-free-development_zh/details)

### Install
* install `tmux`
* copy `tmux/.tmux.conf` to your home directory
* append contents in `tmux/.bashrc` to your `.bashrc` file

### Notice                                                                  
*  Because `.tmux.conf` and `.bashrc` are hidden files. It will not be shown when you type `ls` on your shell in directory `tmux`, use `ls -al` instead.
