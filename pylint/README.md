### Pylint 
`pylint/dotpylintrc` contains the basic **pylint** configuration i use in my working.  

### Install
* install `pylint`
* copy `pylint/dotpylintrc` to your home directory and rename it to `.pylintrc`

### Infos
* according to the [doc](http://docs.pylint.org/run.html#command-line-options) of `pylint` the searching order of `pylint` configuration is:
  * `pylintrc` in the current working directory
  * If the current working directory is in a Python module, `Pylint` searches up the hierarchy of Python modules until it finds a `pylintrc` file. This allows you to sepcify coding standards on a module-by-module basis. Of course, a directory is judged to be a Python module if it contains an `__init__.py` file.
  * The file named by environment variable `PYLINTRC`
  * if you have a home directory which isn't `/root`:
    * `.pylintrc` in your home directory(**This is the one i choose**)
    * `.config/pylintrc` in your home directory
  * `/etc/pylintrc`
* This basic `pylint` configuration file is generated by the following command, i.e. with no reports and the output message is colorized.
```
pylint --reports=no --output-format=colorized --generate-rcfile > $HOME/.pylintrc
```
