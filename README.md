### GNU-Linux-Configs
All remarkable and usable configurations of GNU/Linux in my own Linux.

Learning is always amazing.

#### Tmux
'tmux/.tmux.conf' contains the **tmux** configuration i used in my working job.

Note that almost all the configuration i used is copied from [tmux-productive-mouse-free-development_zh](https://www.gitbook.com/book/aquaregia/tmux-productive-mouse-free-development_zh/details)
